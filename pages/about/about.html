          <h3 class="my-3">Project Description</h3>
          <p>Our project, The Mentor Marketplace, is a large, versatile, crowd sourced forum, which is designed to address the social justice issue of lack of education, primiarily through resolving the current information gap in the world. Our brilliant team recgonized that the modern world, though making leaps and bounds of progress in many areas, is failing at sharing and increasing the accessbility of this information to the large majority of the world and the common everyday indivudal.</p>
          
          <p>With college becoming increasingly more expensive, in addition to larger amounts of biased and fake news populating our news feeds daily, there seems to be little hope for valuable and essential information to be shared by the <b>few</b> to the <b>many</b>. That is where the <u>Mentor Marketplace</u> comes in to play. By enlisting profiles of educated, qualified and credibile indivuals, who specialize in their fields, we aim to create these "channels" of enlightened indivuals in a friendly, collaborative style <b>community</b>. Any one seeking advice on an issue, or looking to learn a new skill in a field can come to our site, register, and subscribe to as many profiles as they wish, for a relatively small fee. By aiming to grant these mentors large audiences and databases of followers, they can achieve a substantial income in exchange for sharing their insight and knowledge to large fanbases. Similarly, these mentees can hope to recieve adequate information and knowledge for a relatively small fee out of their wallets, in addition to being part of a large, fastly growing community of knowledge and truth!</p>
